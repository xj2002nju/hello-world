# hello-world
A repository is the folder where all files and codes are saved.
When you start a project, create a jira, in which, create a new branch using checkout.
A branch is a copy of another branch (such as the main). This branch is remote.
git pull the remote respository to your local machine and all the changes are done in your local copy.
Once the change is done, commit the change. 'commit' is to tell Git to save the change, so that you can always to go back to the change anytime in future. git will ask you why you have made the change when commit.
If you make changes to many files but only want a version control of some of the files, use 'add' before commit.
Once all the changes are done and commited, it is time to push the changes to the remote branch.
pull request is to ask other people to do code review and an approval for a merge.
Once a pull request is approval, you can merge your remote branch to the main branch.
